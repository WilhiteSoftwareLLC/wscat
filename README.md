Examples
--------

If you ever used `nc`, `wscat` works pretty much the same.

### Connect to a server

```
$ wscat echo.websocket.org
Hello
Hello
Who's there?
Who's there?
^D

```

### Chat

Server:

```
$ wscat -l 12345
Hi there!
Hi!
It's nice to speak to someone who just dosn't repeat everything I say back at me.
Yeah! Isn't it?!
Sorry, gotta run...
^D

```

Client:

```
$ wscat localhost:12345
Hi there!
Hi!
It's nice to speak to someone who just dosn't repeat everything I say back at me.
Yeah! Isn't it?!
Sorry, gotta run...
```

### Transfer a file

Server:

```
$ wscat -b -l 12345 < ~/Desktop/mycat.jpg
```

Client:

```
$ wscat -b localhost:12345 > igotacat.jpg
```

Note that you can have the client send the file as well, after the connection has been setup `wscat` does not differentiate between server/client.

### Get your bitcoin on

```
$ echo '{"op":"unconfirmed_sub"}' | wscat -k wss://ws.blockchain.info/inv
```

The `-k` option is used to keep the socket open after the command has been sent, allowing us to read the continuous stream of Bitcoin transactions.


Developing
----------

This node.js program is written in TypeScript and has a compile step that you can run with `make lib`. For developing it is convenient to install the `ts-node` and `typescript` modules  globally (`npm i -g ..`), this will allow you to directly execute the programs entry-point: `./src/cli.ts`.

Use `make test` to run the tests and lint check and `make lint` to run the linter in formatter mode.
